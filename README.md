## Hydrator ##
**Cause you need to drink (water!)**


Develops the habit of drinking small amounts of water throughout your daily routine.

(See complete [Guide](http://codemonkeyhealth.com/the-code-monkey-health-guide/ "CMH Guide to Health for Programmers")  for even more info! [[also on GitHub](https://github.com/codemonkeyhealth/codemonkeyhealthguide "Code Monkey Health Guide on GitHub")])

### Goal: ###

Drink ½ to 1 full ounce of water per pound of bodyweight every day.
Bodyweight ÷ 2 = minimal number of ounces of water your body needs to remain upright and breathing every day.

This equation does not take into consideration other needs of your body such as off-setting coffee, tea, soda or alcohol intake. 

### Best practices: ###

Fill a suitable container with fresh filtered or tap water and keep it with you throughout your day.

### Beginners: ###

If you currently do not drink this amount of water begin by adding 8 ounces of water to your daily routine.  Increase by 8 ounces every 2 to 4 days.

#### Why You Need Hydrator ####

The World Health Organization reports ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive lung disease as the leading cause of death globally.

Researches have concluded that ALL of these diseases are significantly impacted by hydration, or more accurately the lack thereof.

In other words, the state of chronic, mild dehydration contributes to or possibly causes  3 of the 4 leading causes of death - globally. 

#### The three we know for sure proper hydration helps: ####
1. The study results from "Water, Other Fluids, and Fatal Coronary Heart Disease" published in the American Journal of Epidemiology (Vol. 155, No.9) reveal that drinking high amounts of plain water is as important as exercise, diet, or not smoking in preventing coronary heart disease. 
2. The Journal of the Neurological Sciences study "The influence of fluid intake on stroke recurrence--a prospective study" concluded: data suggests that a fluid intake of more than 2000 ml per day might be a protective factor in secondary stroke prevention.
3. The Cleveland Clinic nutritional guidelines for COPD patients includes a minimum of 6 to 8 eight-ounce glasses of non-caffeinated beverages daily. 

So why does water matter so much?  

Water has 2 primal functions in the human body: carry nutrients into and drive toxins/toxics out of cells.  

The way these two functions impact the body is fascinating.  Speaking, healing, sleeping, breathing, even basic movement is contingent upon having the right type and amount of water available.  

A steady influx of water is best for hydration purposes. A fast flooding of water is best for flushing purposes.  This is why [WakeandFlush](https://github.com/codemonkeyhealth/wakeandflush "Wake and Flush") utilizes 16 to 24 ounces of water upon waking. But hydration requires a softer touch. You want to water your body the same gentle way you would a garden, not pressure wash it like your deck or driveway.

Ideally, water would be your beverage of choice. Realistically, that is not going to happen. I have a cup of coffee (with real cream and real sugar) along with a half consumed cola sitting on my desk as I type this. AND I AM A HEALTH COACH AND TRAINER!!!

However, I have also dripped a gallon of fresh filtered water into my lovely self since I've been awake today - not including my [WakeandFlush](https://github.com/codemonkeyhealth/wakeandflush "Wake and Flush") intake.
